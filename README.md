## **Project 3:** <a href="https://dimikara.github.io/Memory-Game/" target="_blank">**Memory Game**</a>

___

## **Project 4:** <a href="https://dimikara.github.io/Arcade-Game/" target="_blank">**Arcade Game**</a>


I was provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate a version of the classic arcade game Frogger. 

I learnt JavaScriptâ€™s **Object Oriented Programming** features to write eloquently designed **classes** capable of creating **countless instances** of similarly functioning **objects**.

## **Project 7:** **MyReads: A Book Tracking App (React)**

A **bookshelf app** that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes **using React** to build the application and provides an API server and client library that I used to persist information as the user interacts with the application.
