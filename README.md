## **Project 3:** <a href="https://dimikara.github.io/Memory-Game/" target="_blank">Memory Game</a>

The objective of this project was to build a version of the classic memory game 'Concentration', using **JavaScript**, **DOM selectors** and **Event Listeners**.

## **Project 4:** <a href="https://dimikara.github.io/Arcade-Game/" target="_blank">Arcade Game</a>


I was provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate a version of the classic arcade game Frogger. 

I learnt JavaScript’s **Object Oriented Programming** features to write eloquently designed **classes** capable of creating **countless instances** of similarly functioning **objects**.
